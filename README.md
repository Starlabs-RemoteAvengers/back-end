## Description
This platform is designed to enable mental health patients to schedule, manage, and receive reminders for their medical appointments. Patients can create an account with their name, surname, phone number, and personal identification number. They also have the option to provide additional information in their profile, such as allergies, general health conditions, and more.
## Why We Chose the Hexagonal Architecture
We opted for the Hexagonal Architecture due to its numerous benefits that align well with the goals of our project:
### Modularity and Separation of Concerns
By following the Hexagonal Architecture, we can clearly separate the core business logic from external concerns such as databases, user interfaces, and external services. This modularity enhances maintainability and facilitates future changes or updates.
### Testability
The Hexagonal Architecture promotes testability by isolating the core domain logic from external dependencies. This allows us to write comprehensive unit tests for our business logic, ensuring its reliability and robustness.
### Flexibility and Adaptability
Our choice of the Hexagonal Architecture enables us to adapt more easily to changes in requirements or technology. Should we need to switch database providers, modify the UI framework, or integrate new external services, the core business logic remains unaffected, minimizing the impact of such changes.
### Domain-Driven Design Alignment
The Hexagonal Architecture aligns well with Domain-Driven Design principles, enabling us to focus on modeling the core domain logic without being tied to specific technical implementations. This results in a more maintainable, understandable, and scalable codebase.
## How We Implemented the Hexagonal Architecture
Our implementation of the Hexagonal Architecture follows these key principles:
